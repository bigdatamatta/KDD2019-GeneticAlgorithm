# KDD2019-GeneticAlgorithm-LSTM

### This is a kind of genetic algorithm for Reinforcement Learning Track in KDD2019.

### The code is developed upon the basic of gaft(https://github.com/PytLab/gaft).

##### We used 36 times attempts to get the correct first year policy and then use algorithm algorithm to search the space. For the child generation, we use a LSTM to predict the reward of child to accelerate the convergence. And set up the step length by 0.2.
